# Minor - Real Time Web

## Introduction
In this project I'm going to build a real time web application. I'm going to make a
website that visually represents a real-time data source. Nowadays people expect websites
to be real-time. Think about al the social media platforms. When someone posts something, you want
to see it immediately. Just like whatsapp, when someone sends you a message, you want to see it
directly, you don't want to wait around for multiple seconds.

This is why real-time is very popular right now. It's fast and more importantly, it's what people
expect, and as a frontend developer this is what should trigger you.

## What did I make
For this project we worked with socket.io. I made a chat app, working with socket.io.
First I made the basics of a chat app. Online people can send a chat to other online people.
